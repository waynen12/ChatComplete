/// Knowledge Analytics MCP Tool - Provides external access to knowledge base management and analytics
///
/// This tool wraps the existing KnowledgeAnalyticsAgent functionality to make knowledge base insights
/// accessible to external MCP clients for monitoring, management, and optimization purposes.
///
/// Key Features:
/// - Comprehensive knowledge base summaries and statistics
/// - Document counts, chunk statistics, and storage metrics
/// - Activity levels and usage patterns
/// - Orphaned collection detection and synchronization status
/// - Sorting and filtering options for different management needs
///
/// Dependencies:
/// - KnowledgeAnalyticsAgent: Existing analytics logic implementation
/// - IKnowledgeRepository: Knowledge metadata from SQLite database
/// - IUsageTrackingService: Usage statistics and activity tracking
/// - ISqliteDbContext: Direct database access for detailed metrics
/// - IVectorStoreStrategy: Vector store collection verification
///
/// Usage Examples:
/// - Monitoring: Track knowledge base health and usage
/// - Management: Identify collections needing attention
/// - Optimization: Find storage optimization opportunities
/// - Maintenance: Detect synchronization issues between databases
