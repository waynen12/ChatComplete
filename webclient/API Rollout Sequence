Roll-out sequence
1 Scaffold ChatComplete.Api → plug in CORS & Swagger.

2 Stub endpoints with static responses so the React app can call without crashing.

3 Flesh out KnowledgeService and connect /api/knowledge CRUD.

4 Hook chat endpoint to ChatService (non-streaming first).

5 Verify end-to-end: upload docs → chat grounded answers.

6 Enhance chat with SSE streaming; update React sendMessage to consume stream.

7 Add long-running upload → background processing (step B-6) if needed.

8 Harden: validation errors, 404s, auth toggle, logging.
